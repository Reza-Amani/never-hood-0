in SingleCell.cs:91 happened: 
	(world.PointsArray[_new_x, _new_y].cell was not null,
	 went to 93: if( (hump > world.PointsArray[_new_x, _new_y].cell.hump)
		here, it was null!
At the same version, the error of "the object is in use somewhere else" happened many times in face in update_face n multicell. Every time it could continue despite the bug
